# Experiment 6: For and While Loops

## Aim:
To write C++ programs using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to print number sequences, patterns, and implement flow control such as password authentication and `continue` usage.

---

## Software Used:
- Turbo C++ / Code::Blocks / VS Code
- g++ Compiler (GNU C++)

---

## Theory:
1. Loops are control structures that allow repeating a block of code multiple times.
2. The `for` loop is ideal when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
3. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update.
4. Syntax: `for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)`
5. The `while` loop is used when the end condition is determined during execution.
6. It checks the condition before executing the loop body.
7. Syntax: `while(condition) { /* body */ }`
8. The `do-while` loop guarantees at least one execution before checking the condition.
9. Syntax: `do { /* body */ } while(condition);`
10. The `continue` statement skips the remaining loop body and proceeds with the next iteration.
11. Loops are commonly used to handle repetitive tasks such as displaying patterns or sequences.
12. Nested loops (loops inside loops) are helpful in creating number and star patterns.
13. Loop variables help track progression in sequences and conditional outputs.
14. Using loops with `if` and `continue`, specific outputs can be skipped dynamically.
15. User input can be handled inside loops to validate or authenticate data.
16. Loop constructs are foundational in all programming languages and promote code efficiency.

## Conclusion:
This experiment strengthened the understanding of loop structures in C++. By working with `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, we learned how to manage repetitive tasks, print formatted patterns, and handle user interactions effectively. Loops simplify logical implementation and are a critical part of structured programming.
